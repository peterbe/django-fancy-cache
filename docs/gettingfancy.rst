Getting fancy
===============

Invalidation based on key prefix
--------------------------------

That :ref:`gettingstarted-chapter` stuff is basically what you get
from standard Django. Now let's get a bit more fancy. For starters you
want to write some very specific code to effectively control the
invalidation.

Suppose you have a view that represents a blog post. The blog post
contains a list of comments. You want the page cached but as soon as a
new comment is added, the page should be cleared from cache.

Step one, add the prefixing::


    def latest_comment_prefix(request, pk):
        try:
            latest, = (
                Comment.objects.filter(post_id=request.pk)
                .order_by('-date')[:1]
            )
            return latest.date.strftime('%f')  # microsecond
        except ValueError:
            return 'no-comments'

    @cache_page(3600, key_prefix=latest_comment_prefix)
    def blog_post(request, pk):
        post = Post.objects.get(pk=pk)
        comments = Comment.objects.all().order_by('date')
        return render(request, 'post.html',
                      {'comments': comments, 'post': post})

That means that the page will be cached nicely based on the latest
comment. If a new comment is added, it's going to have a different
timestamp and thus the blog post view cache will be refreshed.

However, this means that if no new comments are added for a while, we
have to do that look-up each and every time. Better cache that too.
Here's an updated version::

    from django.core.cache import cache

    def latest_comment_prefix(request, pk):
        cache_key = 'latest-comment-for-%s' % pk
        timestamp = cache.get(cache_key)
        if timestamp is None:
            try:
                latest, = (
                    Comment.objects
                    .filter(post_id=request.pk)
                    .order_by('-date')[:1]
                )
                timestamp = latest.date.strftime('%f')
            except ValueError:
                timestamp = 'no-comments'
            cache.set(cache_key, timestamp, 3600)
        return timestamp

So we're looking up what the latest comment is and caching it for the
same amount of time as we cache the view. That means that the least
effort you need to return fresh view is to do 1 cache look-up which is
very fast.

But now you're committed to this timestamp value for one hour (aka.
3,600 seconds) which isn't cool. You want a fresh view immediately
after a new comment is added. Waiting one hour isn't good enough. You
have a choice here. You can either hook in some code in where new
comments are created in another view or you can use signals. Like this::

    # now in models.py

    from django.db.models.signals import post_save
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from django.core.cache import cache

    @receiver(post_save, sender=Comment)
    def invalidate_latest_comment_timestamp(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        pk = instance.post.pk
        cache_key = 'latest-comment-for-%s' % pk
        cache.delete(cache_key)

Now you get the ideal set up you can have. Almost. All it takes to
render the blog post page is 1 quick cache look-up. And as soon as a
new comment is posted, the page is immediately refreshed.

As soon as you've implemented something like this and you get
confident that your ``key_prefix`` callable is good you can start
increasnig the timeout from one hour to one week or something like
that.

Another realistic use case of this is if your logged-in users get
different content but whatever it is, it can be cached. Here's an
example of that::

    def dashboard_prefix(request):
        # it depends on the user
        if not request.user.is_active:
            # no cache key applicable
            return None
        return str(request.user.pk)

    @cache_page(60 * 60 * 24, key_prefix=dashboard_prefix)
    def users_dashboard(request):
        if not request.user.is_active:
            raise FuckOff()
        stuff = get_interesting_stuff(request.user)
        return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {'stuff': stuff})


Keeping your cache hot
-----------------------

Invalidation works fine for performant views but what about slow views.
Ideally you'd refactor them to make them more perfomant but sometimes that's
an expensive or impractical option. Simply append ``?setcache=<secret_key>``
to your url::

    $ curl https://example.com/slowview/?setcache=<secret_key> > /dev/null

If the setcache value matches your setting's ``SECRET_KEY`` then the
cache will always be set regardless of the timeout on the cache content matching
https://example.com/slowview/.

In the event that you need to use an insecure method for calling the setcache
you should set ``FANCY_CACHE_SETCACHE_KEY`` which will be used instead of the
``SECRET_KEY``. Setting ``FANCY_CACHE_SETCACHE_KEY = None`` will disable the
setcache behaviour.

To keep your cache hot you could use an external service to ping your
urls or setup a scheduled management command that crawls them internally
with the django test client.


Remembering what's cached
-------------------------

Writing an advanced ``key_prefix`` callable gives you a lot of
flexibility. You site is probably filled with lots of interesting edge
cases and other pieces of data that affect what it means for a page to
be fresh and when it needs to be invalidated.

A simpler approach is to let ``django-fancy-cache`` keep track of *all*
its internal cache keys so that you can reverse that based on a URL.

Again, let's imagine you have a blog post that shows the latest
comments. As soon as a new comment is added you want the blog post to
refresh. The first thing you need to do is make all cached
URLs remembered. Add this to your settings::

    FANCY_REMEMBER_ALL_URLS = True

Now, every time ``django-fancy-cache`` wraps and caches a view it
remembers what the URL was and what cache key it led to. Now, let's
add a signal that uses this information to invalidate the cache when a
new comment is added::

    # in models.py

    from django.db.models.signals import post_save
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
    from fancy_cache.memory import find_urls

    @receiver(post_save, sender=Comment)
    def invalidate_latest_comment_timestamp(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        post_pk = instance.post.pk
        post_url = reverse('blog:post', args=(post_pk,))
        find_urls([post_url], purge=True)

Voila! As soon as a new comment is added to a post, all cached URLs
with that URL are purged from the cache.

The page is now aggressively cached meaning you're ready for the next
Hacker News stampeding herd, and as soon as a new comment it added the
page is refreshed automatically so people don't get stale content.


Do some last minute fixes to the output
---------------------------------------

Suppose that you want to cache the view rendering but only apply
certain cool optimizations to the rendered output just before the rendered
output is put into the cache. Or perhaps you have some piece of code
that you can't easily weave into your view code.

What you can do, is some "last minute" changes to the response with a
callable function like this::

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from fancy_cache import cache_page

    def css_stats(response, request):
        no_styles = response.content.count('</style>')
        response.content += (
            '\n<!--\n'
            'This page has %s style tags\n'
            % no_styles
        )
        return response

    @cache_page(3600, post_process_response=css_stats)
    def my_view(request):
        something_really_slow...
	return render(request, 'template.html')

The example is a bit silly but it demonstrates what you can do with
the ``post_process_response`` parameter.


Post process the response on every request
------------------------------------------

Suppose you have one of those sites where the content is identical to
all anonymous users and or all logged in users. I.e. the content looks
the same not matter if you're logged in as Tom, Dick or Harry. Just as
long as you're logged in.

Additionally, your page is one of those that says "You're logged in as Tom"
somewhere in the upper right hand corner. Then, the only thing that
needs to be different is the name of the logged in user. What you can
do is this. First change your template to look something like this::

    # in dashboard.html

    <html>
      <header>
      You're logged in as *LOGGED_IN_NAME*
      </header>

      <section>
        {% for thing in stuff %}
        ...
        {% endfor %}
      </section>
    </html>

Now, make the view cache the whole content but replace the currently
logged in name each time. Something like this will work::

    def logged_in_love(response, request):
        html = response.content
        html = html.replace(
            '*LOGGED_IN_NAME*',
            request.user.first_name
        )
        response.write = html
        return response

    @cache_page(60 * 60, post_process_response_always=logged_in_love)
    def users_dashboard(request):
        if not request.user.is_active:
            raise FuckOff()
        stuff = get_interesting_stuff(request.user)
        return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {'stuff': stuff})

An alternative solution to this is to use client-side programming and
render the HTML without any name and then use one snappy and simple
piece of AJAX/localStorage code that updates the header accordingly.


Not all query string parameters matter
--------------------------------------

By default, the ``cache_page`` decorator automatically creates a cache
key based on the URL and the query string. That means that
``/blog/?page=2`` is going to be different from ``/blog/?page=3``.
Makes sense. But if you enter a URL like ``/blog/?page=2&other=junk``
it's a new URL that means it can't use the cached content used for
``/blog/?page=2`` and that's not good. It means the server has to
generate a new page for every piece of junk query string that is
requested. Perhaps you confidently know that the only query string
parameter that means something is ``page`` and its value.

What you can do is supply ``only_get_keys`` to hint that only certain
GET variables matter. It looks like this::

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from fancy_cache import cache_page

    @cache_page(3600, only_get_keys=['page'])
    def my_view(request):
        something_really_slow...
	return render(request, 'template.html')

Now, if someone requests ``/blog/?page=2&other=junk`` they will get
the exact same cached response if they request
``/blog/?page=2&different=junk`` or ``/blog/?page=2&other=crap``.
It'll all act as if the URL was ``/blog/?page=2``.

Note: the order of keys does *not* matter.
